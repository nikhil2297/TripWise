# TripWise
This is a mini college project

TripWise is calculating expenses of a trip and dividing it into following members.
This app is for those groups which are not good in handling bills and final calculation 

For now storing data room is used as a database

MVVM architecture.

Commicunication class is used to communicate between viewmodel and database.
And made in such a way that further we can also add HTTP type in it
